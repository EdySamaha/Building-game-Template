# Zoo game 3D template
First Github project

This project is a template/foundation of a 3D zoo game made using Unity engine and coded in C#.
It was built to this point entirely by myself. I was asked to develop it by 2 of my colleagues in university, and it was a fun challenge to see how my skills were improving while teaching myself how to develop games.

## Requirements
[Unity game engine](https://unity3d.com/get-unity)

## Usage
The user imports his/her models into the project file, and is now able to price, classify, and build them in-game, which will also affect the status of the Player.

## Project Status
The basic "Building" system is complete. Still need to add the "Visitors" features like in a real-life zoo game.
