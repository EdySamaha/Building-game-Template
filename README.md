# Zoo game 3D template
First Github project

This project is a template/foundation of a 3D zoo game made using Unity engine and coded in C#.
It was built to this point entirely by myself. I was asked to develop it by 2 of my collegues in university, and it was a fun challenge to see how my skills were improving while teaching myself how to develop games.
